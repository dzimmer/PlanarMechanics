===============

A free Modelica library for planar mechanical multi-body systems


## Library description

The PlanarMechanics library is an open-source Modelica library for the modelling of planar mechanical mulitbody systems. Its main components are:
- parts such as mass, rigid rods, fixation.
- joints such as prismatic joints or revolute joints
- force elements such as spring and dampers
- sensors and sources
- components for vehicles: wheel models
- componntents for gearboxes
- many examples
