<p>Library <b>PlanarMechanics</b> is a <b>free</b> Modelica package providing 2-dimentional mechanical components to model <b>mechanical systems</b>, such as robots, mechanisms, vehicles, where MultiBody library is too complex to use. The main features of the library are:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Much more <b>compact</b> than MultiBody library, which means fewer parameters to be set, shorter time to build up a model-based system, in the meanwhile containing important information as much as possible.</li>
<li>A <b>PlanarWorld</b> model could be used to set up almost all global parameters, such as visualization of global coordinate system, animation parameters of joints, parts, sources etc., and gravity definition as well as its animation. Note that, in most cases the animation parameters set in PlanarWorld model can be also overwritten in individual model.</li>
<li><b>Built-in animation properties</b> of all components, such as joints, forces, bodies, sensors. It enables a easy visual check of the constructed model. What&apos;s more, in all models animation can be disabled respectively, while in the PlanarWorld model animations of  all models are able to be switched off.</li>
</ul></p>
