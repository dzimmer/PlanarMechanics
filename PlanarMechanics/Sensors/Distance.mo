The <b>distance</b> between the origins of frame_a
and of frame_b are determined and provided at the
output signal connector <b>distance</b>. This
distance is always positive. <b>Derivatives</b> of this
signal can be easily obtained by connecting the
block
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der\">Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der</a>
to \"distance\" (this block performs analytic differentiation
of the input signal using the der(..) operator).
</p>
<p>
In the following figure the animation of a Distance
sensor is shown. The light blue coordinate system is
frame_a, the dark blue coordinate system is frame_b, and
the yellow arrow is the animated sensor.

<p>
If the distance is smaller as parameter <b>s_small</b> (in the \"advanced\" menu),
it is approximated such that its derivative is
finite for zero distance. Without such an approximation, the derivative would
be infinite and a division by zero would occur. The approximation is performed
in the following way: If distance > s_small, it is computed as sqrt(r*r) where
r is the position vector from the origin of frame_a to the origin of frame_b.
If the distance becomes smaller as s_small, the \"sqrt()\" function is approximated
by a second order polynomial, such that the function value and its first derivative
are identical for sqrt() and the polynomial at s_small. Futhermore, the polynomial
passes through zero. The effect is, that the distance function is continuous and
differentiable everywhere. The derivative at zero distance is 3/(2*s_small).
