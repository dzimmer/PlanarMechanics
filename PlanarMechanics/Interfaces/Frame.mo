<p>Frame is a connector, which lies at the origin of the coordinate system attached to it. Cut-force and cut_torque act at the origin of the coordinate system and are resolved in planarWorld frame. Normally, this connector is fixed to a mechanical component. But this model is never used directly in a system. It is only for usage of inheritance.</p>
